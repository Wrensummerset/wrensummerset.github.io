  <h1>Wren Summerset</h1>
<p>If you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten ~ Tony Robbins</p>

<p>My name is Wren. I have been an online ESL instructor for nearly
 3 years which allowed me to be an at home mom to my 3 little 
 yahoos. I enjoy spending time with my kids walking through the 
 beautiful park and walking trails that take us to our local 
 library. I'm on a journey to become self directing. In the past
  my story was largely scripted by others. I finally see that this
   was not in my best interest, nor did it serve my children/family,
     as I once believed. I'm learning to flex and stretch beyond 
     the boundaries that were set for me.</p>
