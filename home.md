# About me

My name is Wren Summerset.  I have been an online ESL instructor for the past 2 1/2 years which allowed me to be an at home
mom to my 3 little yahoos.  I enjoy spending time with my kids walking through the beautiful park and walking trails that take us to our local library. We can easily spend several hours there before heading home along the same path where we can watch nature change through the seasons and identify different plants and animals in the area.

 I'm on a journey to become self directing.  In the past my story was largely scripted by others. 
I finally see that this was not in my best interest, nor did it serve my children/family, as I once believed.  
I'm learning to flex and stretch beyond the boundaries that were set for me.


# Goals

My goal with Ctrl+Shift Code school is to use the resources available to me to empower myself with the skills and tools 
that will allow me to go out into the world on my own terms.  I hope to one day be able to turn around and offer the same to 
others.

Agile leads to adult work environments.

People don’t leave the work, they leave bad managers.

 I worked a job where the multiple managers wandered the office looking over our shoulders assessing productivity, telling us if our clothes were too casual for the work environment, which by the way, did not involve physical interaction with clients, At one point we were told to not speak to co-workers while we worked because they wanted productivity to improve. Anything I wanted on my desk had to be approved.  More than once, they insisted that I save bathroom breaks to company scheduled break times.  I had been so excited to start working here because it was better pay than I’d ever made before, but within 6 months I was dreading the alarm clock and feeling resentful about the time I spent prepping for and traveling to the job.  I was doing my best, sitting in my cubicle trying to not zone out. I tried really hard to be an adult and responsible and fulfill the expectations, but it seemed like I couldn’t keep every expectation fulfilled and so one of my several managers always had something to poke at me about.  When my husband said he wanted to join the military and move our family, it wasn’t hard to convince me.

One of my favorite work experiences involved a company where my boss was over 6000 miles away. 
It was so simple.  The pay incentivized workers to show up on time, fulfill their contracted work for the contracted time, and to provide appropriate feedback.  It was revolutionary to me.  It was my first working experience where I was treated as an adult.  If I fulfilled the set expectations, I got paid a previously set amount.  The better I performed the more likely I was to get return clientele and the easier it would be to fill my schedule.  It wasn’t perfect, and there were certainly things I hated about the job, but I held on to that job for years even when I really wanted to  be done with it.

For companies to be successful, they have to be willing to stop staring so hard at their bottom line, and be willing to take a good long look inside; where their employees are working.  Are employees inadvertently being disinsentivized to be active collaborators with company goals?  Do they see their company as an enemy to fight?  Its tough enough fighting for a place in the market place without also battling the very people meant to keep you afloat.  This is where Agile comes into play.

Agile provides a framework flexible to its work environment, where groups collaborate the plan for accomplishing the desired tasks.  After this initial planning meeting, “sprint meetings” will be held where employees will report their work, not only for transparency but in order to be supported in overcoming any obstacles they’re facing regarding their piece of the puzzle.  This ensures appropriate communication between everyone involved.  Large projects are broken down into simpler smaller ones and helps sweep projects along at a better pace, as no one is getting bogged down in giant tasks.  

Human nature is what it is.  When treated as adults, people tend to return adult actions.  Policing employees is counterproductive to the ultimate end goal.  It may be unsettling trying to cultivate new work environments and cultures, but wouldn’t it be nicer to put company energy towards coordinated efforts that deliver quality end results for the client?  In the end, that bottom line is bolstered and the company better able to manage the rough waters out there.
